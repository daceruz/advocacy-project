# Advocacy Project
The Advocacy Project was a webpage designed in coordination with Codepath.org as a part of their Intro to Web development course. This webpage is a centralized place to get well informed on the topic and problem of marginalized children around the world. 

## Demonstration
Below you will see the main page of the website, giving you the title, description and picture to show the problems that our world faces today.

This project was mainly used a way to send a message about this topic, and to demostrate my advancemnet in the foundation of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

One great feature was the signing of the petition at the very bottom of the page. This was created to show the support of others in real-time, but allowing any and all users to submit their petition for changes they want to see in the support of marginalized children. After signing, users would be shown a quick imaging, confirming their support, and adding their name to the list.

This project was extremely helpful in learning more about the topic for myself, and to my skills as a developer. As my skills continue to grow, I plan on revisiting this project, to hopefully have deployed live for anyone to access, and learn more.
